# Advent of code 2022
My solutions for advent of code 2022. All solutions are fairly optimised and should run easily in under 10 seconds.
Most will run in under 1 second. Extensive use of dynamic programming and memoisation where effective to bring runtime down.
In case of the c++ code everything was done in a single file. All solutions except day 13 are implemented in c++. 
Day 13 is implemented in c# and rust. I simply felt like trying my c# skills for a problem.
I tried to get comfortable with the rust programming language so I did a few problems in rust. 
Quite a few of my rust implementations are translations from my c++ implementations as I wrote the c++ implementation first however as I got more experience with rust I tried to approach the implementation from a rust standpoint more often.
I hope to do next year in another language such as rust or c#. 
I decided to use c++ this year because I wanted to get more comfortable with solving general problems in c++.
However I felt like the use of c++ is unnecessary for these problems as throughput wasn't ever a problem and if it was c++ did not 'save' me from it either. 
The AOC problems are smartly created in a manner where brute forcing is never the right option.
